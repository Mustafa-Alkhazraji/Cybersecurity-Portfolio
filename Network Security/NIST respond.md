### Executive Summary

This report outlines the application of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to enhance the organization's network security posture, following a recent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack via an ICMP flood. The incident exposed a critical vulnerability in an unconfigured firewall, leading to a two-hour network outage. This document details strategies across the five core NIST CSF functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—to mitigate future risks and bolster overall cybersecurity resilience.

### Incident Summary

The organization recently experienced a DDoS attack where an attacker launched a flood of ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets into the internal network. This ICMP/ping flood overwhelmed network services, rendering them unresponsive and disrupting normal internal network traffic for two hours. The incident management team successfully mitigated the attack by implementing temporary blocks on incoming ICMP packets and taking non-critical network services offline, allowing critical services to be restored. Post-incident investigation confirmed the attack vector was an unconfigured firewall, which failed to filter the malicious ICMP traffic.

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework Plan

This plan integrates analysis of the recent incident with strategic improvements across the five core NIST CSF functions:

#### 1. Identify

**Objective:** Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.

**Assessment based on incident:**
* **Technology/Assets Affected:** The primary assets affected were the **internal network infrastructure** (routers, switches, firewalls) and all **network services** dependent on its availability. This includes web design, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions platforms.
* **Process/Business Environment Affected:** Critical **operational tasks** and **network resource accessibility** for all staff were severely disrupted for two hours, directly impacting the company's ability to provide services to small businesses.
* **People:** All **staff** reliant on the internal network for their daily operations were affected, indicating a broad impact on productivity and service delivery. Key stakeholders include IT staff, management, and end-users.
* **Identified Vulnerability:** The core vulnerability identified was an **unconfigured firewall** that allowed a massive influx of ICMP packets, directly leading to the network being overwhelmed.

**Future Actions for "Identify":**
* Conduct regular, comprehensive audits of all internal network devices, systems, and applications to maintain an accurate asset inventory.
* Regularly review firewall configurations and network architecture diagrams to ensure all security controls are properly configured and operational.
* Assess critical business processes and their dependencies on network services to understand the impact of potential future disruptions.

#### 2. Protect

**Objective:** Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services.

**Actions taken and future safeguards:**
* **Access Controls:**
    * Implement new **firewall rules to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets** (rate-limiting).
    * Configure **Source IP address verification** on the firewall to check for and block spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets.
    * Ensure all network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) have strong, non-default administrative credentials and MFA enabled where supported.
* **Protective Technology:**
    * Implement and properly configure an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** to filter out ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics (e.g., abnormally high rates, unusual packet sizes).
    * Regularly update and patch all network hardware, operating systems, and security software to protect against known vulnerabilities.
* **Awareness and Training:**
    * Conduct security awareness training for all staff on incident reporting procedures and the importance of adhering to security policies.
* **Information Protection Processes and Procedures:**
    * Update network security policies and procedures to include new firewall configurations, rate-limiting, and IP spoofing detection guidelines.
    * Establish a consistent maintenance schedule for all network devices and security tools.

#### 3. Detect

**Objective:** Develop and implement appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.

**Actions taken and monitoring improvements:**
* **Anomalies and Events:**
    * Implement **network monitoring software** (e.g., a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system like Splunk or LogRhythm) to collect and analyze logs from firewalls, routers, and other network devices.
    * Configure alerts for abnormal traffic patterns, such as sudden spikes in ICMP traffic, unusual connection attempts, or sustained high bandwidth usage.
* **Security Continuous Monitoring:**
    * Continuously monitor network traffic for security events. This includes monitoring for ICMP floods, unusual port activity, and potential DDoS signatures.
    * Regularly review `tcpdump` or `Wireshark` captures for detailed packet analysis when anomalies are detected, specifically looking for spoofed IP addresses and high volumes of ICMP echo requests.
* **Detection Processes:**
    * Ensure the IDS/IPS system is configured with up-to-date threat signatures to effectively identify and filter malicious ICMP traffic.
    * Develop and test playbooks for detecting various types of network-based attacks.

#### 4. Respond

**Objective:** Develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.

**Incident response actions and improvements:**
* **Planning:**
    * Establish a formal Incident Response Plan (IRP) specifically detailing steps for DDoS attacks, including clear roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols.
    * The analysis from this incident report will serve as a foundational guide for future response procedures.
* **Communications:**
    * Develop predefined communication channels and templates to promptly inform end-users, management, and potentially affected third parties (e.g., web hosting providers) about incident status, impact, and estimated resolution times.
    * Ensure IT staff are trained on incident communication protocols.
* **Analysis:**
    * During an incident, immediately analyze network logs (firewall, router, IDS/IPS) to identify the attack vector, source, and affected assets.
    * Perform forensic analysis of packet captures (`tcpdump`) to understand the characteristics of the attack (e.g., spoofed IPs, packet size, rate).
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Rapidly block incoming ICMP packets** at the perimeter firewall as a primary mitigation for ICMP floods.
    * **Take non-critical network services offline** to preserve resources for critical services and prevent widespread disruption.
    * **Isolate affected network segments** if possible, to contain the spread or impact of the attack.
* **Improvements:**
    * Conduct post-incident reviews (lessons learned) after every security event to identify weaknesses in the response plan and implement process improvements.
    * Regularly update incident response playbooks based on new threat intelligence and past incident experiences.

#### 5. Recover

**Objective:** Develop and implement appropriate activities to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.

**Recovery actions and communication:**
* **Recovery Planning:**
    * Prioritize restoration of critical network services. During the attack, non-critical services were taken offline to prioritize recovery of essential functions. This prioritization should be formalized in a recovery plan.
    * Ensure configurations (e.g., firewall rules, network device settings) are backed up regularly to facilitate rapid restoration to a known good state.
* **Improvements:**
    * Evaluate the effectiveness of implemented rate-limiting and IP spoofing verification rules post-incident to ensure they can prevent similar floods.
    * Invest in redundant network infrastructure and services to minimize downtime during future attacks.
    * Review bandwidth provisioning to ensure the network can handle higher traffic loads, potentially absorbing smaller DDoS attacks.
* **Communications:**
    * Communicate transparently with end-users regarding the status of network service restoration and expected full operational recovery.
    * Provide clear instructions to IT staff regarding the sequence and verification steps for bringing services back online.
    * Once the ICMP flood has subsided and the network shows stable performance, systematically bring non-critical network systems and services back online.
