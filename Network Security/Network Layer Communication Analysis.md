# Cybersecurity Incident Report: Network Layer Communication Analysis

**Date:** July 15, 2025

### Incident Overview

Customers reported an inability to access `www.yummyrecipesforme.com`, encountering the error message "destination port unreachable" after page load attempts. Initial investigation by the cybersecurity analyst confirmed the error. Network analysis using `tcpdump` revealed that UDP DNS queries (to port 53) were met with ICMP "Destination Port Unreachable" messages. This indicates a critical issue with DNS resolution, preventing users from obtaining the website's IP address.

### Summary of the Problem Found in the DNS and ICMP Traffic Log

The core problem identified from the `tcpdump` logs is that the **DNS service** (operating on UDP port 53) is unreachable.

* **DNS Server State:** The DNS server at `203.0.113.2` is not responding to DNS queries. The ICMP "Destination Port Unreachable" error specifically indicates that the UDP packet sent to port 53 on the destination host `203.0.113.2` was rejected because no application was listening on that port. This implies the DNS service on that server is either down, not running, or blocked.
* **Affected Protocol and Port:** The affected protocol is **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**, and the specific port is **53**. Port 53 is the well-known port universally assigned for the **Domain Name System (DNS)** service.
* **Impact:** Since DNS resolution is failing, clients (including web browsers) are unable to translate `www.yummyrecipesforme.com` into an IP address, which is a prerequisite for establishing a connection to the web server. This directly prevents access to the website.
* **ICMP Response Significance:** The ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) "Destination Port Unreachable" message is crucial. It's a network layer message indicating that a datagram could not be delivered to its destination due to the specified port being closed or no application being available to receive traffic on that port. This confirms the issue is at the DNS server's end, preventing it from processing DNS requests.

### Analysis of the Data and Cause of the Incident

**Time Incident Occurred:** The timestamps in the log, such as `13:24:32.192571`, indicate the incident was occurring around 1:24 PM.

**How the IT Team Became Aware:** The IT team was alerted by multiple customer reports stating they could not access `www.yummyrecipesforme.com` and observed a "destination port unreachable" error in their browsers.

**Actions Taken by the IT Department to Investigate:**
1.  **Initial Confirmation:** A security engineer independently attempted to access `www.yummyrecipesforme.com` and confirmed the "destination port unreachable" error.
2.  **Network Analysis:** The team utilized `tcpdump`, a network analyzer tool, to capture and inspect network traffic generated when attempting to access the website.
3.  **Key Findings from `tcpdump`:**
    * Outgoing requests were UDP packets sent from the analyst's machine (`192.51.100.15:52444`) to the DNS server (`203.0.113.2.domain`) on port 53.
    * In response, the analyst's host received ICMP error messages indicating "udp port 53 unreachable" from the DNS server `203.0.113.2`.
    * These errors were consistent across multiple attempts, confirming a persistent issue with DNS resolution on port 53.

**Likely Cause(s) of the Incident:**

Based on the "Destination Port Unreachable" ICMP error specific to UDP port 53 from the DNS server, the most likely causes of this incident are:

1.  **DNS Service Not Running or Crashed:** The most direct interpretation of "port unreachable" is that there is no process (i.e., the DNS server software like BIND, PowerDNS, etc.) listening for incoming UDP connections on port 53 at the destination IP address `203.0.113.2`. This could be due to a service crash, a manual stop, or a configuration error preventing the service from starting.
2.  **Firewall Blocking (on the DNS Server):** A firewall implemented on the DNS server (`203.0.113.2`) itself, or an intermediate firewall, might be explicitly configured to block incoming UDP traffic on port 53. This would cause the server to actively reject the packets and send an ICMP "unreachable" message, as opposed to simply dropping them (which would result in a timeout).
3.  **DNS Server Overload/Resource Exhaustion (less likely for "unreachable"):** While a Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack *could* bring down a DNS server, an "unreachable" message suggests the *port itself* is closed or unresponsive, rather than just being too busy to reply. If it were solely an overload, one might expect timeouts or dropped packets more often than a direct "unreachable" error from the server itself, unless the server actively shut down its service under duress. However, if the attack caused the DNS service process to crash or stop, it would lead to this error.

**Less Likely but Possible Causes:**

* **Incorrect DNS Server Configuration:** The DNS server might be misconfigured to not listen on UDP port 53, or it might be listening on a different interface/port not accessible from the outside.
* **Network Segmentation/Routing Issue:** While "port unreachable" typically originates from the destination host, severe routing issues or misconfigured network segments *could* potentially lead to this, though it's less direct than the service being down or blocked.

**Next Steps for Resolution:**

The immediate action should be to investigate the DNS server at `203.0.113.2` directly. This includes:

* Verifying if the DNS service (e.g., `named`, `dnsmasq`, etc.) is running.
* Checking the server's firewall rules to ensure UDP port 53 is open for incoming connections.
* Reviewing system logs on the DNS server for any errors, crashes, or indications of a DoS/DDoS attack.
* Confirming network connectivity to the DNS server at a basic ICMP (ping) level to rule out general network outages.

By addressing the root cause of the DNS port 53 unreachability, access to `www.yummyrecipesforme.com` should be restored.
