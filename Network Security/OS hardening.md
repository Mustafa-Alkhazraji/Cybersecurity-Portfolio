### Incident Overview

On July 21, 2025, `yummyrecipesforme.com` experienced a significant cybersecurity incident resulting in website defacement, customer redirection to a malicious look-alike site, and potential malware distribution. The attack was initiated through a successful brute force attack on the web host's administrative account, leveraging a weak, likely default, password. The attacker gained unauthorized access to the website's source code, injecting a JavaScript function that prompted visitors to download and execute a malicious file disguised as a browser update. This file subsequently redirected affected customers to a fake website (`greatrecipesforme.com`) hosting the company's proprietary recipes for free, while also reportedly causing performance degradation on customer machines.

### Part 1: Identification of Network Protocols Involved

The incident involved multiple network protocols at different stages of the attack and its execution:

1.  **Domain Name System (DNS - UDP Port 53):** DNS was utilized for name resolution at two critical points:
    * Initial resolution of `yummyrecipesforme.com` to its legitimate IP address.
    * Subsequent resolution of the malicious `greatrecipesforme.com` to its new, fake IP address, facilitating the redirection.
2.  **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP - TCP Port 80):** HTTP (carried over TCP) was the primary application-layer protocol exploited for:
    * **Initial Website Access:** The browser uses HTTP to request and receive the `yummyrecipesforme.com` webpage.
    * **Malware Delivery:** The injected JavaScript code within the legitimate website's HTTP response triggered the download of the executable malware file via HTTP.
    * **Redirection:** After malware execution, the browser was forced to initiate a new HTTP request to `greatrecipesforme.com`.
3.  **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** As the underlying transport protocol for HTTP, TCP was essential for establishing and maintaining reliable connections between the client (browser) and the web server for webpage loading, malware download, and subsequent redirection.

The brute force attack itself, targeting the web host's administrative account, likely occurred over a management protocol such as **SSH (TCP Port 22), RDP (TCP Port 3389), or HTTPS (TCP Port 443)** for a web-based admin panel, before the attacker could inject the malicious client-side code delivered via HTTP.

### Part 2: Detailed Incident Documentation

**Customer Reports:**
Several hours after the compromise, the company's helpdesk received numerous customer complaints. Customers reported being prompted to download a "browser update" file when visiting `yummyrecipesforme.com`. Upon running the file, their browsers were redirected to a different URL, and their personal computers experienced noticeable slowdowns.

**Initial Investigation by IT Department:**
1.  **Website Owner's Attempted Access:** The website owner was unable to log into the admin panel, indicating a potential account compromise or lockout.
2.  **Sandbox Environment Creation:** A cybersecurity analyst created an isolated sandbox environment to safely investigate the suspicious website behavior without risking further compromise to internal systems.
3.  **Network Traffic Analysis (`tcpdump`):**
    * The analyst visited `yummyrecipesforme.2com` within the sandbox while running `tcpdump`.
    * Upon loading the page, a prompt to download an executable file (disguised as a browser update) appeared. The analyst permitted the download and execution.
    * Immediately after execution, the browser was redirected from `yummyrecipesforme.com` to `greatrecipesforme.com`, a deceptive website mirroring the original but offering proprietary recipes for free.

**Log Analysis Findings:**
The `tcpdump` logs clearly illustrate the attack flow:
* **Phase 1: Initial Access & Compromise:**
    * `14:18:32.192571`: Analyst's machine (`your.machine.52444`) queries DNS (`dns.google.domain`) for `yummyrecipesforme.com`.
    * `14:18:32.204388`: DNS replies with the correct IP address (`203.0.113.22`) for `yummyrecipesforme.com`.
    * `14:18:36.786501` onwards (Flags [S], [S.], [.], [P.]): A successful TCP three-way handshake and subsequent HTTP GET request for the webpage are observed, indicating the browser successfully connected to `yummyrecipesforme.com`.
    * *(Implicit from scenario)*: After the initial HTTP GET, the malicious JavaScript embedded in the server's response was delivered to the browser.
* **Phase 2: Malware Download & Redirection:**
    * *(Implicit from scenario)*: A new HTTP request from the browser initiates the download of the malicious executable file from `yummyrecipesforme.com`.
    * *(Implicit from scenario)*: The analyst accepts and runs the downloaded file. This client-side execution then triggers the redirection.
    * `14:20:32.192571`: The browser requests a DNS resolution for the new malicious URL, `greatrecipesforme.com`.
    * `14:20:32.204388`: DNS responds with the IP address (`192.0.2.17`) for `greatrecipesforme.com`.
    * `14:25:29.576493` onwards: A new TCP connection and HTTP GET request are initiated to `greatrecipesforme.com`, successfully redirecting the browser to the fake site.

**Senior Analyst Findings & Root Cause:**
A senior analyst confirmed that `yummyrecipesforme.com` was indeed compromised. Investigation of the website's source code revealed the malicious JavaScript injection. Further analysis of the downloaded executable file confirmed its purpose was to redirect visitors to `greatrecipesforme.com`.

The root cause of the initial compromise was identified as a **brute force attack** against the web server's administrative account. This attack was successful because:
* The administrative account was using a **default or easily guessable password**.
* There were **no security controls in place** to prevent or mitigate brute force attempts (e.g., account lockout thresholds, multi-factor authentication, IP-based blocking).

This vulnerability allowed the disgruntled baker to gain unauthorized access, alter the website's legitimate code, and facilitate the distribution of malicious software and redirection.

### Part 3: Recommended Remediation for Brute Force Attacks and OS Hardening

To prevent future brute force attacks and enhance the overall security posture (OS Hardening), the following remediation measures are strongly recommended:

1.  **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * **Action:** Enable and enforce MFA for all administrative accounts, especially those with access to web host panels, servers, and critical systems. This typically involves a one-time password (OTP) sent to a registered mobile device or email, or using authenticator apps/hardware tokens.
    * **Benefit:** Even if an attacker guesses the password, they will be unable to log in without the second factor, effectively neutralizing brute force attempts.

2.  **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**
    * **Action:** Implement and enforce policies requiring complex passwords (minimum length, combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters). Prohibit the use of default or commonly used passwords.
    * **Benefit:** Makes passwords significantly harder to guess or crack through brute force.

3.  **Implement Account Lockout Policies:**
    * **Action:** Configure systems to temporarily or permanently lock accounts after a predefined number of consecutive failed login attempts (e.g., 3-5 attempts within a short timeframe).
    * **Benefit:** Deters brute force attacks by limiting the number of guesses an attacker can make.

4.  **Rename/Disable Default Administrator Accounts:**
    * **Action:** Change the default username (e.g., `admin`, `administrator`, `root`) for administrative accounts to unique, non-obvious names. If possible, disable default accounts entirely and create new ones.
    * **Benefit:** Makes it harder for attackers to identify the target account for a brute force attack, as they now need to guess both the username and password.

5.  **Restrict Administrative Access by IP Address:**
    * **Action:** Limit access to administrative panels and server management interfaces (e.g., SSH, RDP) to specific, trusted IP addresses or ranges (e.g., the company's internal network or VPN IPs).
    * **Benefit:** Drastically reduces the attack surface by only allowing access from authorized locations, preventing brute force attempts from arbitrary internet IPs.

6.  **Deploy and Configure Web Application Firewalls (WAF):**
    * **Action:** Implement a WAF in front of the web server. Configure it to detect and block common web-based attacks, including credential stuffing, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and unusual login patterns indicative of brute force.
    * **Benefit:** Provides an additional layer of defense at the application layer, protecting against exploits that might bypass traditional network firewalls.

7.  **Regular Security Patching and Updates:**
    * **Action:** Establish a rigorous schedule for patching and updating all operating systems, web server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx), content management systems (CMS), and plugins.
    * **Benefit:** Addresses known vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit, even if brute force fails.

8.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Action:** Ensure that all user accounts, especially administrative ones, only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their job functions.
    * **Benefit:** Limits the damage an attacker can do even if they successfully compromise an account.

By implementing these comprehensive hardening measures, `yummyrecipesforme.com` can significantly reduce its vulnerability to brute force attacks and enhance its overall resilience against similar cyber threats.
