# Security Risk Assessment Report: Network Hardening

**Date:** July 21, 2025
**Prepared For:** Social Media Organization Management

### Executive Summary

This report outlines a security risk assessment conducted in response to a recent major data breach that compromised customer personal information. The assessment identified four critical network vulnerabilities: shared employee passwords, default database administrative credentials, inadequate firewall rules, and the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). These vulnerabilities significantly increase the risk of future attacks and data breaches. This report recommends key network hardening tools and methods, including MFA implementation, strong password policies, and robust firewall management with port filtering, to mitigate these risks and enhance the organization's security posture.

### Scenario Recap: Incident and Identified Vulnerabilities

The organization recently suffered a significant data breach, leading to the compromise of sensitive customer data, including names and addresses. An inspection of the organization's network identified the following four major vulnerabilities that contributed to the breach and pose ongoing risks:

1.  **Employee Password Sharing:** Employees are sharing passwords, undermining individual accountability and increasing the risk of unauthorized access if a single shared credential is compromised.
2.  **Default Database Admin Password:** The administrative password for the organization's database is still set to its default value, making it highly susceptible to brute force attacks or dictionary attacks.
3.  **Inadequate Firewall Rules:** The existing firewalls lack properly configured rules to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic, leaving the network exposed to various threats and unauthorized communications.
4.  **Absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA is not implemented across the organization's systems, meaning that a compromised password alone is sufficient for an attacker to gain access.

Without immediate action to address these vulnerabilities, the organization remains highly susceptible to future data breaches, unauthorized access, and other cyberattacks.

### Part 1: Selected Hardening Tools and Methods to Implement

To address the identified vulnerabilities and establish strong network hardening practices, the following three key tools and methods are recommended for implementation:

1.  **Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * **Description:** MFA requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to an application or resource. These factors typically fall into categories: "something you know" (e.g., password, PIN), "something you have" (e.g., security token, smartphone, smart card), or "something you are" (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition, retina scan).
    * **Application:** MFA should be enforced for all critical systems, especially administrative accounts, VPN access, and access to sensitive data repositories.

2.  **Enforcing Strong Password Policies and Account Lockout:**
    * **Description:** This involves establishing strict rules for password creation (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements including a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) and regularly auditing compliance. It also includes implementing account lockout mechanisms that temporarily or permanently disable an account after a specified number of consecutive failed login attempts.
    * **Application:** These policies should apply to all employee accounts, administrative accounts, and service accounts across the network.

3.  **Performing Regular Firewall Maintenance and Implementing Port Filtering:**
    * **Description:** This involves routine review and updating of firewall security configurations to ensure they effectively detect and block current threats. **Port filtering** is a specific firewall rule that blocks or allows network traffic based on specific port numbers, thereby limiting unwanted communication and reducing the network's attack surface.
    * **Application:** Firewalls at the network perimeter and internal network segments must be regularly audited, updated, and configured with explicit deny-by-default rules, allowing only necessary ports and protocols.

### Part 2: Explanation of Recommendations

These recommendations directly address the identified vulnerabilities and contribute significantly to a robust network hardening strategy:

1.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    * **Addresses Vulnerabilities:** Directly mitigates the risk posed by shared passwords and the default admin password. Even if an attacker obtains a password through brute force or social engineering, they will be unable to gain access without the second authentication factor.
    * **Benefits:** MFA significantly reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access. It adds a crucial layer of security that makes brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and phishing attempts far less effective. It promotes secure identity and access management by requiring a more robust verification of user credentials before granting network access.

2.  **Enforcing Strong Password Policies and Account Lockout:**
    * **Addresses Vulnerabilities:** Directly combats the risk of shared passwords and the default database admin password. By requiring complex passwords, the organization makes it exponentially more difficult for attackers to guess or crack credentials. Account lockout mechanisms actively deter brute force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts, making automated guessing impractical.
    * **Benefits:** Strong password policies enhance the overall strength of authentication credentials. Combined with account lockout, they form a fundamental defense against automated and manual password-guessing attacks, protecting user and administrative accounts from compromise.

3.  **Performing Regular Firewall Maintenance and Implementing Port Filtering:**
    * **Addresses Vulnerabilities:** Directly resolves the vulnerability of firewalls lacking rules to filter traffic. Regular maintenance ensures that firewall configurations remain effective against evolving threats, while port filtering specifically addresses the need to control inbound and outbound network communication.
    * **Benefits:** A well-maintained firewall with strict port filtering rules acts as the primary network perimeter defense. It can detect and block suspicious incoming and outgoing traffic, preventing unauthorized access to internal services. This measure is crucial for protecting against various types of attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, by limiting the exposed services and controlling the flow of data into and out of the private network. Port filtering ensures that only necessary services are accessible, minimizing the attack surface.

### Conclusion

The implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication, strong password policies with account lockout, and diligent firewall management including port filtering, are critical steps for the social media organization to recover from the recent data breach and prevent future incidents. These measures collectively establish a stronger security foundation, significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access, and protect sensitive customer information, ensuring the long-term integrity and resilience of the organization's network.
