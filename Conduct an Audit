## Botium Toys: Internal IT Audit Report

**Date:** July 21, 2025

**Prepared For:** Botium Toys Management

**Prepared By:** Internal IT Audit Team

### 1. Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of an internal IT audit conducted at Botium Toys. The primary objective was to assess the company's current security posture, identify potential risks, and evaluate compliance with relevant U.S. and international regulations, specifically concerning online payments and operations within the European Union (EU). Our findings indicate a significant need for improvement in critical areas of security controls and compliance, posing a high risk of data breaches, operational disruption, and regulatory fines. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate these risks and establish a robust cybersecurity framework.

### 2. Audit Scope and Goals

* **Scope:** The audit encompassed Botium Toys' entire security program, including all IT-managed assets, internal processes, and procedures related to control implementation and compliance best practices.
* **Goals:**
    * Assess existing IT-managed assets.
    * Complete a controls and compliance checklist to identify necessary improvements in Botium Toys' security posture.
    * Provide an overview of potential risks and fines resulting from the current security state.

### 3. Current IT Assets

The following assets are managed by the IT Department:

* On-premises equipment for in-office business needs
* Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras
* Storefront products (retail sale, online, warehouse storage)
* Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, e-commerce, and inventory management
* Internet access
* Internal network
* Data retention and storage
* Legacy system maintenance (end-of-life systems requiring human monitoring)

### 4. Risk Assessment Overview

**Risk Description:** Botium Toys currently faces inadequate asset management, a lack of proper security controls, and insufficient adherence to U.S. and international regulations and standards.

**NIST CSF "Identify" Function:** A critical first step, as per the NIST CSF, is to dedicate resources to identifying and classifying all assets. This includes determining the potential impact of the loss of these assets, including systems, on business continuity.

**Risk Score:** 8/10 (High)

* This high score is primarily attributed to the absence of essential controls and a lack of adherence to compliance best practices.

**Additional Comments:** The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium. However, the risk of fines from governing bodies and the overall risk to assets are high due to the identified gaps in controls and compliance with critical data privacy and security regulations.

### 5. Controls Assessment

The following table details the current state of security controls at Botium Toys.

| Control                 | Does Botium Toys currently have this control in place? | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                            | Control Type(s)           |

### 7. Recommendations

Based on the audit findings, Botium Toys' current security posture is significantly below acceptable standards, particularly concerning the confidentiality and protection of sensitive information. The following recommendations are critical for improving security and achieving compliance:

1.  **Implement Least Privilege:** Restrict employee access to customer data and other sensitive information to only what is absolutely necessary for their job functions. This is a foundational security principle.
2.  **Develop and Implement a Comprehensive Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP):** Create a detailed DRP that outlines procedures for data backup, system restoration, and business continuity in the event of a major incident or disaster. This should include regular testing of the DRP.
3.  **Strengthen Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies that include complexity requirements, regular rotation, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all access points, especially for privileged accounts and sensitive systems.
4.  **Implement Robust Encryption:** Encrypt all sensitive data, particularly customer credit card information and personally identifiable information (PII), both at rest and in transit. This is a non-negotiable requirement for PCI DSS and GDPR compliance.
5.  **Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Implement an IDS to monitor network traffic and system activity for malicious patterns or policy violations, enabling early detection of potential intrusions.
6.  **Establish Comprehensive Backup Procedures:** Implement regular, verifiable backups of all critical data and systems. This should include a defined backup strategy (e.g., incremental, full, differential) and secure, offsite storage.
7.  **Address PCI DSS Compliance Gaps:** Immediately rectify all identified PCI DSS violations, including restricting access to cardholder data, encrypting stored credit card information, and ensuring secure encryption practices. Consider engaging a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) for guidance.
8.  **Achieve GDPR Compliance:** Develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure full compliance with GDPR requirements for all EU customer data. This includes obtaining explicit consent, honoring data subject rights (e.g., right to access, rectification, erasure), and implementing appropriate data protection measures.
9.  **Implement Strict User Access Policies (SOC):** Establish and enforce granular user access policies based on the principle of "need-to-know" and "least privilege." Utilize role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions effectively.
10. **Regular Asset Inventory and Classification:** Continuously update and maintain a comprehensive inventory of all IT assets. Classify assets based on their criticality and the impact of their loss to the business.
11. **Security Awareness Training:** Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees, emphasizing their role in protecting sensitive data, recognizing phishing attempts, and adhering to security policies.
12. **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and regularly test a formal incident response plan to ensure the organization can effectively detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents.

By addressing these recommendations, Botium Toys can significantly enhance its security posture, reduce the likelihood of data breaches, ensure business continuity, and achieve compliance with critical industry standards and regulations.
